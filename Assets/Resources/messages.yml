    Spectacular! You picked it up. 
    My studies of **<red>E</red><orange>A</orange><yellow>R</yellow><green>T</green><blue>H</blue>** have informed me that the thing you picked up is called a **<red>G</red><orange>U</orange><yellow>N</yellow>**.

    My studies of **EARTH** have taught me that these are **VERY ANNOYING** for **HUMANS**.
