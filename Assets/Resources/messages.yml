    This is **<red>E</red><orange>A</orange><yellow>R</yellow><green>T</green><blue>H</blue>**. **EARTH** is full of unfamiliar things.

    Spectacular! You picked it up. 
    My studies of **EARTH** have informed me that the thing you picked up is called a **GUN**. 
    It is a **WEAPON** used to **HURT THINGS**. 
    Why don’t you give it a go? Press **K**.

    **EARTH** is also full of **STRANGE NOOKS AND CRANNIES**. 
    My studies of **EARTH** have taught me that these are **VERY ANNOYING** for **HUMANS**.

    Just **SQUISH YOURSELF**. Press the **DOWN ARROW**.

    The creatures who live on this planet also have an **ODD PROPENSITY** to **PUZZLES**. 
    These **PUZZLES** are **ANNOYING** and I **DISLIKE** them.
